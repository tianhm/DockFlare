## [v3.0.2] - 2025-09-30

### Added
- **Enhanced API Key Management**
    - **Revoked Key Visibility:** Revoked API keys are now displayed in a separate "Revoked Keys" section with full key visibility for verification and audit purposes.
    - **Permanent Deletion:** Added "Delete Permanently" functionality for individual revoked keys and "Clear All" for bulk removal.
    - **Auto-Cleanup System:** Implemented automatic cleanup of revoked keys after 30 days with manual trigger option.
    - **Improved UX:** Revoked keys are visually distinguished (grayed out, full key shown) with countdown to auto-deletion.
    - **Copy Functionality:** Users can copy full revoked API keys for record-keeping before permanent deletion.

### Fixed
- **API Key Revocation Display Bug:** Fixed issue where revoked API keys remained visible in the frontend as if they were active, even though backend authentication correctly rejected them.

---

## [v3.0.1] (Hotfixes) - 2025-09-27

### Added
- **Enhanced Country Selection UX**
    - **Bulk Selection Controls:** Added "Select All," "Select None," and "Invert Selection" buttons for more efficient country management.
    - **Quick Templates:** Implemented one-click presets such as "Block All Except US," "Block All Except EU," and "Block High Risk Countries."
    - **Regional Selection:** Users can now select entire continents (e.g., Africa, Asia, Europe) with a single click.
    - **Visual Feedback:** A dynamic counter now shows "X of 245 countries selected" to provide immediate feedback.

### Fixed
- **Tedious Manual Selection:** Resolved an issue where "Allow US Only" required manually selecting over 194 countries; it now requires only one click (resolves #240).
- **IP Whitelist Access Policies:** Corrected a bug where IP-based access policies were not functioning as intended. DockFlare now properly creates a `bypass` rule for whitelisted IPs.
- **Access Policy Updates:** Addressed a failure where updating an Access Policy on an existing ingress rule would result in an "application already exists" error.
- **API Error Logging:** The severity of the log message for a `403 Forbidden` error during user email fetches has been reduced, as this is expected behavior with a scoped API token (related to issues #216, #217 raised by @durzo).
- **OAuth Provider Visibility:** Fixed the login screen to respect disabled providers immediately after changes through the API or UI, keeping password-disable overrides intact.

---
## [v3.0.1] - 2025-09-26

### Added
- **OAuth/OIDC Login Support:** Added support for external authentication providers like Google and Authentik via a new, generic OpenID Connect system.
- **OAuth Documentation:** Created a new help document for setting up OAuth providers.

### Changed
- **Redesigned Login Page:** The login page has been updated with a modern design, provider logos, and a unified flow for both password and OAuth logins.
- **Improved Usability:** The settings page now displays the required Callback URL for OAuth providers, and DockFlare can discover its public hostname from Docker labels.
- 
### Security
- **Login Rate Limiting:** Implemented rate limiting on the password login form (6 attempts per minute) to protect against brute-force attacks.

---
## [v3.0.0] - 2025-09-25

### Fixed (Hotfixes)

#### **Agent Container Label Processing**
- **Fixed access policy parsing** for Agent containers - containers with `dockflare.access.policy=authenticate` now display correct policy instead of "None (Public)"
- **Added support for all documented labels** in Agent processing including `dockflare.no_tls_verify`, `dockflare.originsrvname`, `dockflare.httpHostHeader`
- **Implemented indexed labels support** for Agent containers (e.g., `dockflare.0.hostname`, `dockflare.1.service`) for multiple domain configurations
- **Enhanced backwards compatibility** - Agent containers now fully support legacy `cloudflare.tunnel.*` label formats

#### **Migration Logic Improvements**
- **Fixed tunnel migration analysis** - containers with legacy `cloudflare.tunnel.*` labels are now properly recognized during migration instead of showing as "orphaned"
- **Enhanced migration service compatibility** with backwards compatible label checking across all migration functions
- **Improved container matching logic** for more accurate auto-import and conflict detection

#### **Redis Database Configuration Enhancement**
- **Added `REDIS_DB_INDEX` environment variable** - allows specifying Redis database index (0-15) for better isolation when sharing Redis across multiple Docker containers
- **Enhanced Redis URL parsing** - dynamically constructs Redis connection URL with specified database index
- **Maintains full backward compatibility** - existing docker-compose files continue to work without changes, defaults to database 0

#### **Dependencies Security Update**
- **Updated Redis client** from 4.5.1 to 4.5.5 to address security vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-28859, CVE-2023-28858)

## [v2.1.7] - 2025-08-30

### New
- UI: Added a version check feature to the Settings page. This allows users to verify if their running DockFlare instance is up-to-date by comparing the local Docker image digest against the official repository or by checking the latest GitHub release tag.

### Changed
- UI: Reorganized the Settings page to include a left-side sticky navigation and section anchors for improved discoverability and faster navigation.
- UI: Added smooth scrolling and adjusted anchor offset so section headings are not hidden behind the sticky top header when navigating to anchors.
- UI: Left-nav links now resolve to the Settings route with fragment identifiers (e.g. /settings#general-settings) so anchors work from any page.
- UI: Added a small client-side script that highlights the active left-nav item while scrolling (IntersectionObserver with a fallback).
- Fix: Kept all existing form names, IDs and POST endpoints unchanged to avoid breaking backend functionality.

## [v2.1.6] - 2025-08-24

### Security
- **Dependency Vulnerability:** Patched an outdated `brace-expansion` npm package (related to CVE concerning inefficient regex) by updating it to version 2.0.2.
- **Path Injection:** Hardened the `/help/<path:page>` route against path traversal attacks by implementing stricter validation using `os.path.abspath`.
- **Open Redirect:** Secured the login redirect mechanism by validating the `next` parameter to prevent redirection to external, malicious sites.
- **Information Exposure:** Prevented the leakage of sensitive exception details and stack traces in API/JSON responses across multiple endpoints (`/cloudflare-ping`, `/debug`, `/api/v2/debug-info`).
- **Insecure CI/CD Workflow:** Restricted permissions in the GitHub Actions workflow to `contents: read` to adhere to the principle of least privilege.

## [v2.1.5] - 2025-08-24

### New
- **Help Documentation:** Added a comprehensive help section to the web UI, providing users with easy access to documentation and guides.

### Fixed
- **Country Dropdown Menu:** Fixed an issue where the country dropdown menu in the Access Group modal was limited to 50 entries.
- **UI Refinements:** Made various minor refinements to the web UI for improved usability and a more polished user experience.

## [v2.1.4] - 2025-08-23

### New
- **Geo-Fencing Support:** Access Groups now support country-based blocking, allowing you to easily block traffic from specific countries (thanks @psybernoid, #183).
- **Multiple Policies per Rule:** You can now apply multiple Access Groups to a single ingress rule, both via Docker labels (`dockflare.access.groups`) and the web UI, to combine and layer policies (thanks @psybernoid, #183).

### Changed
- **UI/UX Refinement:** The Access Groups manager has been moved from the Settings page to its own dedicated "Access Policies" page in the main navigation bar for improved visibility and workflow.
- **IP-Based Access Policies:** Access Groups now fully support creating policies based on allowed IP ranges (CIDR notation), in addition to emails.


## [v2.1.3] - 2025-08-15

### New
- **Update Cloudflare Credentials:** Added a new section in the Settings page that allows users to update their Cloudflare Account ID and API Token directly from the UI.

## [v2.1.2] - 2025-08-14

### Changed
- **Unified Ingress Rule Editing:** The "Manage Policy" dropdown has been completely replaced by a unified editing modal. All rules (manual or from labels) can now be fully edited using the same comprehensive form.
- The table column for editing has been renamed from "Manage Policy" to "Manage Rule".
- The editing modal has been renamed from "Edit Manual Ingress Rule" to "Edit Ingress Rule".
- The redundant "Edit" button in the "Actions" column for manual rules has been removed to streamline the UI.
- When a rule from a container label is edited via the UI, it is now correctly marked with a "UI Override" flag, and the "Revert to Labels" functionality is preserved.

### Removed
- Removed the `ui_update_access_policy` backend route and associated frontend logic, as it was made obsolete by the new unified editing modal.

### New
- Added Favicon: The web UI now has a favicon, making it easier to spot in your browser tabs.

## [2.1.1] - 2025-08-12

### Added

*   **Revamped Setup Wizard:** The initial setup wizard has been re-sequenced for a more logical flow (User -> Cloudflare -> Tunnel -> Finalize).
*   **Setup Step Indicator:** A visual progress indicator has been added to all setup pages.
*   **Detailed Setup Explanations:** Added clear, descriptive text to each step and field in the setup process to improve user guidance.
*   **Disable Password Login:** Added a new option on the Settings page under "Security" to disable password-based login. This allows for public access to the dashboard, intended for use with an external authentication provider like Cloudflare Access.
*   **Cancel Migration Option:** Added a "Start Fresh" button to the `.env` migration screen, allowing you to cancel the migration and begin a manual setup.

### Fixed

*   Corrected the initial redirect for the setup process, which was pointing to a non-existent route.
*   Fixed a template error that caused a crash on the final step of the setup wizard.
*   Corrected the setup flow logic. When a user proceeds with a migration, they are now correctly taken to the final step after user creation, bypassing unnecessary manual configuration.
*   The "Disable Password Login" setting now persists correctly after restarting the DockFlare container.
*   Resolved a redirect loop (`ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`) that occurred when password login was disabled.

### Changed

*   The `/ping` endpoint is now exempt from authentication to allow for Docker health checks.
*   The `/ping` endpoint now dynamically reports the application version via the config.APP_VERSION variable.
*   The "Change Password" form on the settings page is now hidden when password login is disabled.
*   The user creation page now provides clearer instructions depending on whether the user is in a migration or a fresh setup flow.
*   Updated the security warning text related to disabling password login for better clarity.

## [v2.1.0] - 2025-08-12

This release focuses on simplifying the initial setup, enhancing security with UI authentication, and improving overall usability.

### New

-   **Pre-Flight Setup Wizard:** A new browser-based setup wizard for first-time installations replaces the need for `.env` files. This guides users through configuring Cloudflare credentials and tunnel settings step-by-step.
-   **UI Authentication:** The DockFlare UI is now protected by a login page.
-   **Password Management:** Users can now change their UI password from a new "Security" section on the Settings page. A secure, manual process for password resets has been implemented.
-   **Post-Setup Configuration:** Core settings (Tunnel Name, Zone IDs, Rule Grace Period) can now be modified directly from the UI at any time.
-   **Seamless Migration:** An automatic migration process is in place for existing users to import settings from their `.env` file and create a new UI password.

### Changed

-   **Logout Button:** A logout button has been added to the main navigation bar.
-   **UI/UX:** The theme selector is now an icon-only button for a cleaner interface.

### Security

-   **Encrypted Configuration:** All sensitive credentials, including the Cloudflare API token and UI password, are now stored in a fully encrypted `dockflare_config.dat` file.

### Removed

-   **`.env` File Support:** DockFlare no longer uses `.env` files for configuration after the initial migration. All settings are managed through the UI and the encrypted configuration file.

## [v2.0.4] - 2025-08-12

This is a dedicated security hardening release that reintroduces security enhancements from a previously rolled-back version (v2.0.5). A special thanks to GitHub user **@bcurran3** and Reddit user **t2_hur2hqu6k** for their valuable feedback and for helping make DockFlare more secure.

### Security

-   **CSRF Protection:** All forms in the web UI are now protected with anti-CSRF tokens to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
-   **Strengthened Content Security Policy (CSP):** The CSP has been made more restrictive to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks.
-   **Pinned Dependencies:** All Python dependencies in `requirements.txt` are now pinned to specific versions to ensure build reliability and prevent potential supply-chain attacks.

## [v2.0.1] - 2025-08-05

This is a follow-up release to address several minor bugs found after the major v2.0 update. It also restores support for Bastion mode and introduces a new backup and restore feature.

### New

-   **Backup & Restore via UI:** A new "Backup & Restore" card has been added to the Settings page.
    -   You can now download a timestamped `state.json` backup directly from the UI.
    -   You can upload a `state.json` backup file to completely restore your DockFlare configuration. After a restore, DockFlare automatically reloads the state and triggers a reconciliation to bring your Cloudflare setup in sync.

### Added

-   **Bastion Mode for Browser SSH/VNC:** Re-introduced and fixed support for **Bastion Mode** (`bastion`) as a service type in the manual rule creation UI. This service type is used for Cloudflare's browser-rendered SSH and VNC. Unlike other service types, it does not require an internal service address to be specified in DockFlare; it enables a secure gateway at the public hostname, which you then connect to using the `cloudflared` client on your local machine.

### Fixed

-   **UI:** Fixed an issue where the DNS record toggle button (`+`) for tunnels on the Settings page was not functional after the UI reorganization.
-   **State Management:** Corrected a bug where the `access_group_id` for a rule was not being saved to or loaded from the `state.json` file. This caused the "Group:" display in the UI to be empty for Docker-managed rules after a restart.
-   **UI:** The "UI Override" badge and "Revert" button will no longer be displayed for manual rules, as they have no Docker labels to override or revert to.
-   **Validation:** Fixed a validation error that incorrectly rejected `bastion` as a valid service type, which prevented browser-based SSH/VNC rules from being created.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-01

### Added

-   **Access Groups:** Introduced a major new feature for centralized policy management. You can now create reusable policy templates (Access Groups) in the UI and apply them to any container or manual rule with a single `dockflare.access.group` label.
-   **New "Settings" Page:** Added a dedicated page in the UI to house configuration and infrastructure details, including the new Access Groups manager, the list of all Cloudflare Tunnels, and the agent status.
-   **Official Project Website:** Launched the official website at [https://dockflare.app](https://dockflare.app), which now serves as the central hub for documentation, guides, and project information.

### Changed

-   **UI Overhaul:** The user interface has been significantly reorganized for a better workflow.
    -   The main page is now a focused **Dashboard** displaying only Managed Ingress Rules and Real-time Logs.
    -   A new top navigation bar has been added for easy switching between the Dashboard and Settings.
    -   "Add" and "Edit Manual Rule" modals now integrate seamlessly with Access Groups, allowing you to assign a group from a dropdown menu.
-   **Backend Policy Management:** The entire backend logic for handling labels and access policies has been refactored to support the new Access Groups system.
-   **UI Polish:**
    -   The logo in the header has been moved to the left, mirroring the layout of the new project website.
    -   Modals with a large amount of content will now scroll correctly.

### Fixed

-   **Centralized Versioning:** The project version number is now managed from a single source to prevent inconsistencies across the UI.

## [1.9.5] - 2025-07-27

### Fixed
- **Agent Container Startup Resilience:** Resolved a critical issue where the managed `cloudflared` agent container would fail to start if its associated Docker network was removed and recreated. The startup logic in `tunnel_manager.py` now intelligently detects this "stale network" error, automatically removes the broken agent container, and creates a new one, significantly improving reliability in dynamic Docker environments.

## [1.9.4] - 2025-07-19

### Fixed
- **Auto-Redirect for Identity Providers:** Resolved a regression from v1.9.0 where using the `access.auto_redirect_to_identity=true` label along with `access.allowed_idps` would result in a Cloudflare API error. The `access_manager.py` module has been corrected to include the required top-level `allowed_idps` field in the API payload, restoring the auto-redirect functionality for label-based rules.

## [1.9.3] - 2025-07-19

### Fixed
- **Critical UI Fix for Access Policies:** Resolved a critical bug causing an 'Internal Server Error' when creating or editing manual rules, or updating a Docker-managed rule's policy, to use the 'Authenticate by Email' method via the web UI. This was a regression caused by recent updates to the Cloudflare Access API handling in `access_manager.py` which were not reflected in the UI routes. The routes in `app/web/routes.py` have been updated to correctly construct the Access Policy payload, resolving the `TypeError` and API validation errors.

## [1.9.2] - 2025-06-25

### Added
- **HTTP Host Header Support:** Implemented support for the new `dockflare.httpHostHeader` Docker label, allowing users to override the `Host` header sent to their origin service. This feature is also fully supported for manual ingress rules via the web UI (Add/Edit modals and display in the Managed Rules table). Applies only to HTTP/HTTPS services.

### Fixed
- **Service Validation for Docker Names:** Corrected the `is_valid_service` regex to properly allow underscores (`_`) in service hostnames (e.g., `http://my_app:80`), accommodating common Docker service naming conventions.

### Changed
- **Optional Ports for HTTP/HTTPS Services:** Modified `is_valid_service` to make the port optional for `http://` and `https://` service targets (e.g., `http://my-service` is now valid). Default ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS) will be implicitly used by Cloudflare Tunnel if no port is specified.

## [1.9.1] - 2025-06-23

### Added
- **Prometheus Metrics Endpoint:** Added support for enabling the Prometheus metrics endpoint on the managed `cloudflared` agent via the new `CLOUDFLARED_METRICS_PORT` environment variable. The agent container will be automatically reconciled if this setting is added, changed, or removed.

## [1.9.0] - 2025-06-23

### Fixed
- **Automatic Rule Cleanup for Multi-Path Services:** Resolved a critical bug where the background cleanup task failed to process and delete expired rules for multi-path services.
- **`allowed_idps` Label Functionality:** Resolved a bug that caused Cloudflare API errors when using the `access.allowed_idps` label. DockFlare now correctly constructs Access Policy rules using the modern `login_method` keyword.
- **UI Policy Management for Multi-Path Rules:** Corrected an issue where managing Access Policies from the web UI would fail for rules that included a path.
- **Manual Rule Creation:** Fixed a bug preventing manually created rules from being correctly added to the Cloudflare Tunnel configuration.
- **UI Efficiency:** Policy updates from the UI now prevent unnecessary API calls if the configuration hasn't changed.

### Changed
- **Rewritten Rule Cleanup Logic:** The background cleanup task has been completely rewritten to be resource-aware. It now intelligently checks if a shared resource (like a DNS record or Access Application) is still in use by other active rules before deleting it. This ensures correct and stable behavior when managing complex, multi-path services.
- **Improved Cleanup Responsiveness:** The default value for `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` has been reduced from 300 to **60 seconds**, making the automatic deletion of expired rules more responsive and intuitive.

## [1.8.9] - 2025-06-22

### Added
- **Agent Container Reconciliation:** DockFlare now intelligently checks the managed `cloudflared-agent` container on startup. If it detects a configuration mismatch (e.g., wrong network or image version) compared to the `.env` file, it will automatically recreate the agent with the correct settings.

### Changed
- **Startup Logic:** Refactored the main application startup sequence to unconditionally trigger the new agent reconciliation logic, ensuring configuration changes from the `.env` file are always applied.

### Fixed
- **UI Policy Management for Multi-Path Rules:** Corrected an issue where managing Access Policies from the web UI would fail for rules that included a path. The UI now correctly parses the hostname and path, allowing for reliable policy updates.
- **Manual Rule Creation:** Fixed a bug where manually created rules from the UI were not being correctly added to the Cloudflare Tunnel's ingress configuration.
- **UI Efficiency:** Policy updates from the UI now check if the requested configuration already matches the live Cloudflare configuration, preventing unnecessary API calls.

## [1.8.7] - 2025-06-10

### Fixed
- **Critical Agent Startup Fix:** Resolved a bug where the managed `cloudflared` agent failed to start due to a `Provided Tunnel token is not valid` error. The token parsing logic is now more robust, handling both new JSON and legacy raw text responses from the Cloudflare API.

## [1.8.6] - 2025-06-07

### Added
- **Edit Manual Rule Functionality:** A new "Edit" button and modal now allow for direct editing of existing manual ingress rules via the web UI.
- **Intelligent Resource Management:** The backend logic for editing rules now cleanly removes old, unused Cloudflare resources (DNS records, Access Applications) and creates/updates new ones as needed.

### Changed
- **UI Code Reusability:** Refactored UI JavaScript to create a shared helper function for path input logic, reducing code duplication between the "Add" and "Edit" modals.

## [1.8.5] - 2025-05-29

### Added
- **Origin Server Name (SNI) Support:** Added support for specifying `originServerName` for an ingress rule via the `...originsrvname` Docker label and a new field in the Manual Rule UI, allowing for more granular control over TLS connections to origin services.

## [1.8.4] - 2025-05-28

### Added
- **Path-Based Routing:** Introduced the ability to define specific URL paths for ingress rules via Docker labels (`...path=/...`) and the Manual Rule UI.
- **Extended Service Type Support:** Added robust support for `tcp`, `ssh`, `rdp`, and `http_status` service types in addition to HTTP/S.
- **Direct Access Policy on Manual Rules:** The "Add Manual Rule" UI now allows for direct assignment of an Access Policy upon creation.

### Changed
- **UI/UX:** The "Add Manual Rule" modal was restructured for improved clarity, and links in the main table now correctly include the path.
- **Validation:** Implemented stricter validation for service URL formats to ensure proper configuration.

## [1.8.0] - 2025-05-27

### Changed
- **Major Codebase Refactor:** The application was restructured into a modular, package-based architecture (`app/core/`, `app/web/`) to improve maintainability and separation of concerns.
- **Externalized JavaScript:** All inline JavaScript was moved from HTML templates to a dedicated `app/static/js/main.js` file.
- **Enhanced Logging:** Added more detailed logging, including object ID tracking during critical state operations, to aid in debugging.

### Fixed
- **Threading and State Issues:** Resolved several bugs discovered during the refactor, including potential circular imports, state-saving race conditions (by implementing `threading.RLock`), and various `NameError`, `TypeError`, and `AttributeError` exceptions.

## [1.7.1] - 2025-05-22

### Fixed
- **Multi-Zone DNS Scanning:** Corrected an issue where the "All Cloudflare Tunnels on Account" view only scanned for DNS records in the primary `CF_ZONE_ID`, and now correctly respects the `TUNNEL_DNS_SCAN_ZONE_NAMES` setting.

## [1.7.0] - 2025-05-17

### Added
- **Manual Ingress Rule Management:** Introduced the ability to add, manage, and delete ingress rules for non-Docker services directly from the web UI.

### Changed
- **Authoritative Ingress Management:** The tunnel update logic now takes an authoritative stance, ensuring the Cloudflare configuration perfectly matches DockFlare's managed state by removing stale, non-DockFlare rules.
- **UI/UX:** Improved readability of status badges and localized the "Expires At" timestamp to the user's browser timezone.

### Fixed
- **Ingress Rule Deletion:** Resolved a critical bug where deleting a rule would not correctly remove the corresponding ingress rule from the Cloudflare Tunnel configuration.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-05-15
